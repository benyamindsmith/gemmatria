## Description

(_From [Wikipedia]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria)_)

Gematria /ɡəˈmeɪtriə/ (Hebrew: גמטריא or גימטריה, plural גמטראות or גמטריאות, gematriot) is an alphanumeric code of assigning a numerical value to a name, word or phrase based on its letters. People who practice gematria believe that words with identical numerical values may bear some relation to each other or to the number itself. A single word can yield multiple values depending on the cipher used.
